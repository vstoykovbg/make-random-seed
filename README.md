Known bugs
==========

This script `make_random_seed.pl` does not compute the checksum according to a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039">BIP39</a>. Also, if you use the Diceware-like lits you probably will not get a mnemonic seed with correct checksum.

It looks like Electrum 1.9.8 works without computing the checksum. I tested it with an arbitrary mnemonic seed and the program is accepting it.

Electrum 2.9.2 can accept seeds in the old format, BIP39 with checsum and BIP39 without checksum (plus additional arbitrary words - you need to tick `[x] Extend this seed with custom words` to use this feature, it's visible after you click `Options`).

Better (or worse?) alternative to my script
=====

If you are looking for another script that computes seeds with correct checksums: [Mnemonic Code Converter](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/) (JavaScript, requires browser). It allows you to supply your own entropy (if you don't trust your [browser's random number generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RandomSource/getRandomValues)). I did not read the code and presume that this app

Tested it with `1544234774264585` and it gives `coffee forward seat` - so, it looks like it does not mix your entropy with the machine-generated random numbers (like my script do).

You may use the full output of my script (including the `debug` lines and user's input) and copy/paste it into Mnemonic Code Converter as entropy source. This way it will

Possible use cases if you use Electrum 2.9.2
=====

* Old version seed (Electrum 1.x format)
* BIP39 without checksum
* BIP39 with checksum generated by Electrum (not this script) and adding additional words with this script (`Options` => `[x] Extend this seed with custom words`)

Possible use cases if you use another wallet
=====

I did not tested it with other BIP39 wallets, but it sould work if your wallet does not require your seed to have a valid checksum.

Make secure passphrases
=====

Another possible use case is to generate secure passphrase for apps accepting long passphrases. You may add additional security to your passphrase by using my [slow KDF](https://github.com/vstoykovbg/slowkdf).

make_random_seed.pl
===================

Make random seed (random list of words). The program will ask first which word list should be used (Electrum 1.x or BIP39). If you select BIP39 word list, the program will ask how many random words should be chosen. If you select Electrum 1.x word list, the program will choose 12 random words.

For every random word, the program will ask for 7 dice rolls and random string.

You need to install `Math::Random::Secure` and `Crypt::Random` first:

```
$ cpan install Math::Random::Secure 
$ cpan install Crypt::Random
```

See the source code for explaination how it works. Also read this thread on Reddit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/2f9286/is_this_algorithm_good_for_mixing_random_numbers/">Is this algorithm good for mixing random numbers?</a>.

TLDR version (simplified):

```
$really_random_number = decimal_from_dice($user_input_dice) ^  $random_number_from_PRNG ^ number_from_hash(sha256hash( join $random_string_input, $another_random_number_from_PRNG ));
```

Diceware-like lists
===================

The downside of using Diceware-like lists is that you need to "throw away" most of the random numbers made with dice. To choose one random word you need 5 dice rolls. If the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senary">senary</a> number is not in the list, you need to make another 5 dice rolls until you get senary number that is in the list (probably it will take about 25 dice rolls per word).

<b>Only the list for Electrum 1.x is useful because Electrum 2.x and BIP39 wallets require mnemonic code with the correct checksum.</b>
